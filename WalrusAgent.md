This is a *full conceptual redesign*, but still harnessing your Walrus Agents core.

# 🧊 **Step 1 — Understand the Walrus Hackathon (AI x Data Track)**

### Track: **AI x Data**

They want projects that show:

### ✔ **AI that uses on-chain data in real time**

→ "adaptive systems"
→ "AI-driven gameplay/financial loops"

### ✔ **Decentralized AI Training**

→ use *everyone's computers*
→ not centralized servers
→ store model intermediates on-chain using **Walrus**
→ optionally compute on Sui validator edges
→ or using SEAL (confidential compute abstraction)

### ✔ **Walrus as distributed storage**

→ fragments
→ replication
→ verifiability
→ store embeddings, model updates, datasets

### ✔ **Sui smart contracts for coordination**

→ agent identity
→ agent registry
→ payment mechanisms
→ data curation markets
→ model training incentives

### ✔ **SEAL for secure AI execution**

→ run inference/training steps in secure enclave logic
→ produce verifiable outputs
→ useful for trust-minimized agent inference

# 🦁 **Step 2 — Reimagine “Aslan Agents” for the Walrus Protocol**

We're redesigning it to:

## ❌ Remove Hedera-specific features

* Remove HTS, HCS
* Remove x402
* Remove Hedera consensus patterns

## ✔ Replace with Sui-native equivalents

* Sui Move contracts
* Object-based ownership
* Dynamic fields
* Sui events and receipts
* Capabilities pattern

## ✔ Add Walrus for decentralized AI training

* Store embeddings or model deltas on Walrus
* Retrieve fragments to reconstruct snapshots
* Use it as a “training ledger”

## ✔ Add SEAL for privacy-preserving AI inference

* Agents run inference off-chain
* SEAL proves correctness
* Smart contract verifies output roots

---

# 🧠 **Step 3 — New Positioning: Aslan Agents (Walrus Edition)**

New summary:

> **Aslan Agents is a fully decentralized AI agent collective that trains, evolves, and coordinates using the Walrus protocol on Sui.**
> Agents access on-chain data, update their local models collaboratively, store snapshots on Walrus, and use Sui Move contracts for coordination, incentives, and governance.

This is 100% aligned with **AI x Data** track.

---

# 🚀 **Step 4 — The New Core Concept (Walrus + Sui + SEAL)**

## 🔥 **1. Decentralized Agent Training Using Walrus**

Each agent:

* trains micro-updates locally (on user devices or delegated workers)
* pushes **model deltas**
* deltas are **sharded + stored on Walrus**
* global consensus model = aggregate(deltas)
* snapshots stored every N updates

Agents collectively train each other = “Distributed AI Guild”

---

## 🔥 **2. Sui Contract as AI Coordination Layer**

Smart contracts manage:

### **Agent objects**

* type
* skills
* dataset refs
* Walrus snapshot references
* performance score
* owner

### **Training proofs**

* user contributes compute
* submits update
* earns reward token
* contract checks:

  * validity of update hash
  * Walrus commit
  * weighting

### **Data feeds**

Agents interact with:

* DeFi price oracles
* NFT metadata
* Sui object activity
* dApp usage metrics

---

## 🔥 **3. SEAL for Private, Verifiable Inference**

Agents run inference on:

* user machines
* edge nodes
* enclaves

SEAL ensures:

* output is legitimate
* no tampering
* no data leakage
* contract verifies results

This enables **trust-minimized AI**.

---

## 🔥 **4. Adaptive On-Chain Agent Behavior**

Agents evolve based on:

* new model weights from Walrus
* on-chain data patterns
* reward feedback loop
* user-submitted strategies
* simulation of agent-to-agent negotiations

This becomes a **living on-chain ecosystem of evolving AI agents**.

---

# 🧩 **Step 5 — Final Project Direction (100% aligned with AI x Data Track)**

# 🌟 **Project: Aslan Agents — Decentralized AI Factions on Walrus + Sui**

### **Core Idea**

A network of specialized AI agents (your lion, owl, eagle, fox, etc.) who:

* continuously train model deltas via user devices
* store updates & embeddings on Walrus
* coordinate behavior through Sui Move smart contracts
* use SEAL to verify inference
* pull real-time on-chain data to make decisions
* influence DeFi strategy simulations or game loops

### **Use Case Examples**

You can pick 1 or combine:

---

## **(A) Decentralized AI Trading Legion**

Agents analyze:

* Sui DEX prices
* Validator stats
* On-chain behaviors
* Wallet flows

Agents evolve strategies via crowd-sourced Walrus training.

---

## **(B) AI Creature Battler / RTS Game** (Huge wow factor for judges)

Agents:

* learn
* evolve
* gain XP
* get stronger via training
* store “skill embeddings” on Walrus
* battle or compete using their learned strategies

---

## **(C) Knowledge Agents**

Agents build:

* dynamic knowledge graphs
* use Walrus to store facts, embeddings
* coordinate queries
* enable on-chain reasoning tasks

---

## **(D) Decentralized AI Research Cluster**

Users contribute:

* GPU
* CPU
* browser compute

Agents:

* aggregate micro training updates
* move up the performance chart
* provide inference for dApps
* sell trained models

### 🟣 Walrus Protocol

* Model deltas
* Embeddings
* Dataset chunks
* History snapshots

# 🧠 **Step 7 — Your New Storyline (for judges)**

This hits all criteria:

> **Aslan Agents transforms AI into a decentralized, evolving multi-agent civilization powered by Walrus and Sui.**
> Users contribute compute to train agent species, store model updates on Walrus, verify inference with SEAL, and watch the agents collaborate, adapt, and evolve through on-chain data.

---

# ✔️ **This fully fits the AI x Data track.**

It uses:

* decentralized training
* on-chain data
* Walrus storage
* SEAL verification
* Sui contracts
* adaptive AI behavior
* AI x gameplay x automation

It is **unique**, **creative**, **practical**, **judges will love it**, and your agents (lion, owl, eagle, fox) make it **visually unforgettable**.
